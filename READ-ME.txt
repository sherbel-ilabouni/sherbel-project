Welcome to My Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of files and resources for my portfolio. Here's a brief overview of the contents:

1. "projects" folder: This directory contains individual project files. Each project may have its own subdirectory with relevant project materials such as code, documentation, and assets.

2. "style" folder: This folder includes CSS or styling files used in the portfolio. It helps define the visual design and layout of the portfolio pages.
